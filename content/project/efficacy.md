## Description 

How does poverty shape voters' perceptions of political efficacy? While it 
has long been shown that the poor and other economically disadvantaged 
citizens particpate less in politics, we know less about the mechanisms. In 
this project, I focus on the role of political efficacy, both internally and 
externally, to fill this gap. Moreover, by taking into account the 
institutional context (party systems, social policy, and economic 
conditions), I explore factors that can alleviate (or indeed amplify) the 
povert-efficacy gap.
