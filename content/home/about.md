# Biography

I am a post-doc at the [Chair of German Politics](http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/forschung/systeme/polsystem/index.html) 
at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. 

In my work, I investigate how experiences of insecurity and disadvantage 
shape political attitudes and behaviors such as political efficacy, trust, 
and responsibility attributions. 
 
Currently, I am especially interested in the role that emotions, such as 
anger and anxiety, play in translating general grievances into specific 
political attitudes. In this, my work seeks to explore the rise of populism 
and the construction of new political identities.  

I am also interested in research methods and research design. I am interested 
in experimental methods, large-N observational data, but also mixed-method 
and qualitative research designs.
