abstract = """When do voters blame their governments for wanting (economic) 
performance? And how do personal characteristics and institutional context 
interact to shape this process of responsibility attribution? And most 
importantly, how do individual characteristics and institutional context 
interact in the formation responsibility attributions? This question is far 
from trivial, especially in federal systems such as Germany, where voters 
must evaluate not only if the government is responsible or not, but must also 
which level of government is most relevant. \n \n But while the literature on 
economic voting has become increasingly sophisticated in identifying 
individual and institutional factors shaping responsibility judgements, there 
is still surprisingly little work on the interaction between individual and 
contextual factors. This paper aims to bridge this divide by focusing on 
three key drivers of responsibility assessments: Partisanship, reduced 
clarity of responsibility, and the problem of second-order elections in 
federal systems. Specifically, by focusing on relative responsibility 
attribution, the paper explores at which level of government responsibility 
is assigned, and how partisanship and government configurations influence 
this process.  \n \n  Using a newly constructed data-set, the paper exploits 
variations in Germany's state and national governments to show that 
institutional ambiguity enables partisan blame shifting. However, the results 
also show that there are limits to such partisanship, since even partisans 
recognize the importance of national over state level politics."""
