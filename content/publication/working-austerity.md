abstract = """The belief that 
governments are no longer responsive to the needs of “ordinary citizens” has 
become a common charge levied against Western democracies. Compounded by the 
pressures of austerity politics, financial crises, and growing 
financialization`, voters appear increasingly unconvinced that their vote 
matters, particularly when these same pressures have also created feelings of 
relative depravation and socioeconomic exclusion. Faced with such a decrease 
in external political efficacy, these “left behind” voters have not only 
withdrawn from political participation, they have also become increasingly 
receptive to the anti-elite rhetoric of populist parties.  \n \n But while 
calls for more responsive governments have arisen across the political 
spectrum, we actually know surprisingly little about the intersection between 
economic disadvantage, fiscal contraction, and perceptions of government 
responsiveness. Do poverty and austerity reduce external efficacy? And more 
importantly, how do individual disadvantage and austerity at the macro level 
interact in shaping perceptions of efficacy? \n \n Using multi-level 
modeling, this paper shows that there are important interactions between 
individual-level economic disadvantage and austerity. Combining data from the 
Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), the paper shows that: 
\textbf{(1)} poor voters have significantly lower external efficacy, 
\textbf{(2)} that periods of austerity leads to reduced efficacy for all 
voters and most importantly \textbf{(3)} that the poor suffer 
disproportionably from periods of austerity, since they see an even greater 
reduction in external efficacy."""
